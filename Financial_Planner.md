#### Summary and Recommendations

At present, expenses far outpace income.  We recommend to first seek additional income as current and recent past income levels are well below the US Dept of Health and Human Services "Poverty Guidelines of 2020" for a single person/family income. (*[Reference](https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines)*)  Secondly, reducing expenses where possible will help balance expenses vs current income.
